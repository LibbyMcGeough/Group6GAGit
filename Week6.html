                <h4>IDEs are productivity tools for programmers with lots of functionality combined into one program.</h4>
                <p>At the most basic an IDE is a source code editor and will also usually include build automation tools and a debugger. They can also be easily linked to other
                    productivity tools, such as version control systems through plugins to increase their usefulness. An IDE can help increase productivity by highlighting syntax
                    errors, checking for missing packages/modules and easily refactoring code. Some IDEs may have built in compilers and interpreters for a variety of languages.</p>

            <div class="w3-container">
                <h3><b>Version Control System (VCS)</b></h3>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-container">
                <h4>A VCS is a tool used to track production progress by storing incremental versions of the software.</h4>
                <p>VCS tools allow developers to work in groups on the same code with an up to date view of the current version. The main repository will often have several
                different branches, e.g. development and production. Often different features or development environments will have separate branches.</p>
                <h4>Local VCS</h4>
                <p>A local VCS stores a version database on the programmers computer. This functionality is integrated into most IDEs. However it is not suitable if
                the programmer is working in groups with other people and it doesn't have online backups if you lose your project.</p>
                <h4>Centralised VCS</h4>
                <p>A centralised VCS consists of several computers connected to a central server with a version database. Each programmer has a copy of the latest version
                they can make changes to before replacing the newest version on the server. This allows several people to collaborate on a project, however you cannot
                revert back to previous copies and if the server goes down then nobody will be able to access the latest copy.</p>
                <h4>Distributed VCS</h4>
                <p>A distributed VCS consists of a server with a version database and each computer connected also has a copy of the version database. Each of these copies are
                synchronised. This means if the database goes down everyone is able to continue working. Distributed VCS systems are the most widely used in software development.</p>

                <h3><b>Git</b></h3>
            </div>

            <div class="w3-container">
                <h4>Git is an open source distributed VCS used in many software projects.</h4>
                <p>Git works in three stages.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The code is stored in a repository before being checked out by a client and saved in a working local directory.</li>
                    <li>The client can then make changes to the code within the local directory. The files are placed in a staging area and then committed
                        to the local repository.</li>
                    <li>The client then pushes the contents of the local directory to the server.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Commands</h4>
                <p>Git has a command line interface and a GUI. It can also be integrated into most IDEs. Some of the most important git commands:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>git config => configures git with your credentials</li>
                    <li>git version => confirms git is correctly installed</li>
                    <li>git init 'repository' => creates new local repository</li>
                    <li>git clone 'url' => clones git repository to local directory</li>
                    <li>git status => lists all modified files</li>
                    <li>git diff => shows difference between original files and those not yet staged</li>
                    <li>git add 'file' => adds file ready for commit</li>
                    <li>git commit -m'message' => adds to database with message about commit</li>
                    <li>git branch => lists all branches</li>
                    <li>git branch -d'branchName' => adds new branch</li>
                    <li>git checkout 'branchName' => changes branch to working directory</li>
                    <li>git merge 'branchName' => merges current branch to different branch</li>
                    <li>git push => 'pushes local repository to shared repository</li>
                    <li>git pull => 'pulls code from shared repository to local repository</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>GitHub</h4>
                <p>Github is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It contains repositories for projects allowing developers to access them using
                    the repository address provided..</p>

                <h3><b>System Build Tools</b></h3>
            </div>

            <div class="w3-container">
                <h4>System build tools are any tools needed to get a piece of software set up but aren't needed after that.</h4>
                <p>The build tools needed will usually be different in different communities and software types. They are often used in production deployment
                to build a complete, executable environment. In general a build tool should run arbitrary commands, such as movement or zipping, and be able to use the
                results of a command in another command. They are also used for continuous integration to run a build and test flow across every commit in a repository.</p>
