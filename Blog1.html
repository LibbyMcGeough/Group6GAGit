                    <h5>Improving yourself is a key skill to have. In order to do it effectively you need to have a
                        process. I am going to talk about what works best for me </h5>
                </div>

                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p>I would personally say I improve with the maturity improvement process. This is because from my
                        favourite book the author Sommerville says: "The maturity improvement process focuses on
                        improving process and project management and introducing good software engineering practice”. I
                        totally agree with that when it comes to improving myself as you need to think of good ways to
                        try and avoid making mistakes. Also being able to improve yourself on your own shows the key
                        skill that you're independent. Yes, you may get feedback but it’s up to you, what you do with
                        the feedback .Feedback is a very important aspect when it comes to doing the programming
                        exercises especially because you need to know what you should improve to pick the right
                        improvement process.</p>

                    <h3><b>DOCUMENTATION IN MY WORK PLACE</b></h3>
                    <h5>Here is a wee description on how my team documents our work and code
                    </h5>
                </div>

                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p>As mentioned it the book there are code documentation and email documentations and my team uses
                        both of them and also some other ones. There is a list of some of the documentation used and
                        managed in my work:

                        - Software architecture documentation

                        - Software design documentation

                        - API documentation

                        - User Story documentation

                        - Source code documentation

                        - Quality assurance Documentation

                        - Release Process Documentation

                        - Testing Strategies documentation


                        Like mentioned on page 18 of Stephens Beginning Software engineering book these are all used in
                        order to fetch the most recent version of your works documentation, to share documents so that
                        others can view and edit them, to compare 2 versions of a document and see what has changed, to
                        allow multiple people to collaborate in documents, to allow document branches so that you can
                        spilt into many parts and to also allow your emails to notify others if you make any changes.

                        The way my team does documentation is usually using different tools such as Confluence pages,
                        Jira boards and Bit bucket. Whenever someone does a deployment they usually use Confluence to
                        describe what they done and if it worked and the evidence that the updates actually deployed and
                        then they publish it to internal teams. Also when we are coding and we change some kind of code
                        we push it up to our repository on BitBucket and wait till someone reviews our work. When they
                        are reviewing our work they can see what is the new version and what the old one is and once
                        it’s approved by a reviewer it gets merged into the repository and you can view the code changes
                        there and see there descriptions. We also use Jira board with all the tasks that have to be done
                        in the sprint and we document them by assigning the task we r doing to ourselves so others see
                        that someone else is working on it..</p>

                    <h4><b>Improvement process in my work</b></h4>
                    <p>JMy team does indeed use post-mortems however we like to call it a retrospective in my team. We
                        do them every second week which means every sprint. We get all together as a team and have a
                        board with 3 different sections: Enjoyed/more of, went well and Needs improvement. We then get
                        posted notes and write stuff that go under each category. Then we discuss all of the things
                        written down and pick the 3 main concerns and put them on a confluence page and write how we
                        could improve them. Then in 2 weeks’ time we go re visit those issues and update them whether
                        they have been resolved or not. And we repeat this every end of sprint.

                        My team uses the agile improvement process. However the book says: “Primary characteristics of
                        agile methods are rapid delivery of functionally and responsiveness changing customer
                        requirements.” I wouldn’t exactly agree with this because as much as it might be true we use an
                        agile process to improve as a team and try and work things out together. Yes we address our
                        customer requirements but I wouldn’t say it’s rapid. We would rather take a bit of time but make
                        sure the improvement is perfect quality rather than rush it. We document our agile process by
                        something called an agile board. This is all the tasks listed that have to be completed and if
                        you’re working on it you assign it to yourself so no one else works on it.

                        I would say my teams level of maturity is level 3 Defined as it shows in chapter 2.4 in
                        Sommervilles’ book. This is because all of our projects have a plan to them and when we make
                        changes or adapt them we look to the future plans of it.</p>
