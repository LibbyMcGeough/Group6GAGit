                    <h5>I'll give you a wee overview on my team and project management </h5>
                </div>

                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p>According to Stephens Book chapter 3, a project manager has to keep team members on track and to
                        ensure that goals are set, tracked and eventually met. However my team doesn’t have a project
                        managers as project managers are usually in a waterfall team instead of an agile team. We as a
                        team manage our project as we think team options and decisions are a lot better than one
                        person’s decisions. So we don’t have assigned roles of who manages what, we usually come
                        together and decide as a team.

                        From chapter 3 Stephens book they seem to use a PERT chart as one form of documentation however
                        in my team we use Confluence which is basically a text page where you can write about your
                        project and publish it to the internal public and then a JIRA board that has all the teams tasks
                        listed however that is only visible for our team only. We tend to keep our documentation as
                        simple as possible so it’s done fast and its easy for others to understand and The PERT chart is
                        hard to understand and not easy to create.

                        As I mentioned above my team doesn’t have a project manager. We just have people in my team that
                        manage everything together. We all have different knowledge backgrounds which helps as it all
                        varies. Which means people can look at different arguments from different perspectives. We all
                        have different trainings and experience. We don’t have a project manager in my team as we all
                        agree that actually doing the job is better than telling people how to do it. So everyone in the
                        team mostly has coding experience rather than business experience. However if anyone wanted to
                        be a project manager it is quite simple in my team you could just ask the main manager of the
                        team. However this will involve a lot of new training and many interviews and tests as we need
                        to make sure the person will be good at their job.</p>

                    <h3><b>PLANNING IN MY COMPANY</b></h3>
                    <h5>Here is a wee description on how my team plans our work
                    </h5>
                </div>

                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p>In Stephens chapter 3 it talks about using grant charts to plan projects however my team doesn’t
                        use this technique as we don’t like guessing how long a task will take as sometimes it can go
                        very inaccurate and cause the project being delivered late while customers are expecting it
                        early.

                        In fact we like the approach of Algorithmic cost modelling from Ian Somerville’s Book chapter
                        23.5. As it says that this approach is used to compute the project effort based on product
                        attributes, such as size, process characteristics and experience of staff involved. We use this
                        technique all the time. Every end of sprint we come together as a team and plan out how much
                        points we want to give to each task in the next sprint. We all pick a number from ½ - 13. ½
                        meaning it’s something simple and easy to do and 13 means hard and will take a lot of effort.
                        Then we also decide what the most critical tasks to do are and we put them as a priority on our
                        board so they are completed first in the sprint. We like this approach a lot as it gives us the
                        opportunity to discuss the limitations of this task as a team to compare who has what knowledge.
                        Doing it as a team allows us to analyse the tasks better.

                        Also like it mentions in Stephens book chapter 3, breaking a complicated tasks into small pieces
                        that are easier to understand. My team swears by this as it makes life a lot easier for everyone
                        in the team. Having small tasks helps you to understand what is going on and then it provides
                        you with smaller tasks so you take less time doing them but its outcome is more effective as you
                        don’t spend so much time on one massive task trying to understand it.

                        In my opinion there isn't that much of a difference between the books and what my team does. Yes
                        there is some parts that I might not agree with like i mentioned above but it all comes to the
                        preference of your team and how they like to manage tasks. In my team we try and keep tasks as
                        easy as possible to allow us to spend more time on the actual doing of the tasks rather than
                        trying understand it for a long time. </p>

                    <h4><b>Coursework planning reflection</b></h4>
                    <p>My best technique of planning my course work is keeping one week ahead of my schedule. I find
                        this technique good as it helps me always be on time with deadlines. This mainly works well with
                        the CS113 class as we have stone set deadlines. However so far my plan has been working really
                        well however sometimes I just get too busy with my work that I just cannot make the one week
                        ahead plan which the causes stress due to deadlines coming up. So the only way you could improve
                        this plan is by trying your best to find time to complete everything one week ahead.

                        However with CS115 it’s hard to plan my work ahead as we can’t guarantee how long a task will
                        take. In this case I’m technically the project manager for myself. I have a brief description of
                        what I have to do but all the tasks and how I do it needs to be figured out by myself. So
                        planning my project is all up to me. I have done this by a grant chart. However this is very
                        difficult to do because I’m not sure how long each task will take. This is all because I might
                        need training for a part of the project I don’t understand or it might take less time as I
                        already know what to do. So from the Stephens Book chapter 3 it says “You cannot understand how
                        tasks fit into a schedule unless you know how long those tasks will take”. I personally don’t
                        agree with this statement as for me and also my team it’s hard to determine how long something
                        will take. As during that process something might go wrong but also something might go ahead
                        with no issues. So with this approach to work the best way of trying to improve it is my making
                        sure you have the deadline in your head and make sure everything is competed by the end of
                        June.</p>
