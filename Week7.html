            <div class="w3-container">
                <h4>Most software will contain bugs, especially new software. The goal of testing is to remove identify and remove bugs.</h4>
                <p>Removing all bugs from a piece of software is often unrealistic, depending on the size and the complexity of the code. Often testing only achieves minimising
                the number of bugs. It is most important to remove the high profile and potentially dangerous bugs. Eventually there comes a point when the cost of continuing to
                test the software is more than the cost of any potential bugs. Fixing a bug can also be dangerous and causes problems elsewhere, so it is best not to rush them
                and delay fixing them to the next release if you don't have much time. However some bugs, such as security ones, will need to be fixed immediately.</p>
                <h4>Which bugs should be fixed?</h4>
                <p>When deciding when or if to fix a bug you should consider several factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Will the bug have a huge impact on the users productivity of the effectiveness of the software?</li>
                    <li>Are there any easy work arounds to the problem?</li>
                    <li>How frequently does the bug occur?</li>
                    <li>How hard is it to fix the bug?</li>
                    <li>How risky is it to fix the bug? Will it effect other parts of the system?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><b>Types of testing</b></h3>
            </div>

            <div class="w3-container">
                <h4>Systems must be tested at a range of levels to ensure everything is working as it should be.</h4>
                <h4>Unit testing</h4>
                <p>This is the testing of very small chunks of code, usually immediately after they have been written. For instance any new methods should be tested
                straight away to make sure they work before moving on. It is a lot harder to perform these tests in small chunks than all at once later on. If a bug is found
                then it should be tested again to ensure you haven't created another bug.</p>
                <h4>Integration testing</h4>
                <p>This should be performed after unit testing to ensure that a new method or unit correctly integrates with the rest of the system.</p>
                <h4>Automated testing</h4>
                <p>This is the running of specific tests via automation, this is done using separate software and allows you to continually check the system is passing all tests
                and no new bugs have been created.</p>
                <h4>System testing</h4>
                <p>This is an end-to-end run of a complete system to ensure it meets all of its specified requirements.</p>
                <h4>Acceptance testing</h4>
                <p>This is done by working with the customer and running through the software systematically to ensure the product meets all of their requirements.</p>
                <h4>Other testing depending on the type of software or development process may include;</h4>
                <p>Accessibility, alpha, beta, compatability, destructive, functional, installation, internationalization, nonfunctional, performance, security and usability.</p>

                <h4>TDD is a software development approach</h4>
                <p>Originally TDD was part of XP programming, but has since become more widely used as part of agile and plan driven development. In TDD code is developed
                incrementally along with tests, programmers don't move on from the current increment until it has passed all tests. In TDD the tests are usually written before
                the new code is written. TDD also provides good documentation for the project as the every part of the code will have written tests to accompany it.</p>
